Primary Key uniquely identify each record in a table
Foreign Key is used to link two tables together to uniquely identify a row of the same table or another table

Primary Key must containt UNIQUE value and cannot contain NULL values
Foreign Key can have duplicate values and accept NULL Value

A table can have only one Primary Key
A table can have more than one Foreign Key

A table that contains the Primary Key is called the "Parent Table"
A table that contains Foreign Key is called the "Child Table"

Primary Key cannot create parent-child relationship in a table
Foreign Key can make a parent-child relationship in a table

Primary Key constraint can defind on temporary files
Foreign Key constraint cannot defind on temporary files

You can insert the values into the primary key column without any limitation.
While you need to ensure that the value is present in a primary key column while inserting values in the foreign key table

If you want to delete Primary Key, then make sure the referencing foreign key does not contain its value.
The foreign key value can be removed from the table without bothering that it refers to the primary key of another table.

Primary Key Example----

create table School
(
Name varchar(15) NOT NULL,
RollNo int(5),
Age int(3),
constraint consname primary key(Name)
);

Here it will create table with name "School" and First Column name is "Name", Second Column name is "RollNo", Third Column name is "Age"
and "consname" is constraint name(You can defind whatever you want). 
Primary key constraint applied on "Name" column that's why name column cannot accept duplicated and null values in it

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Foreign Key Example---

create table Student
(
Name varchar(15) NOT NULL,
RollNo int(5),
Sub varchar(20),
ScholarNo int(10),
constraint mycons foreign key(Name) references School(Name)
);

Here Foreign key refers to primary key in another table("School"table)

This Query will create table name "Student" with Name is not null field, RollNo, Sub, ScholarNo fields
Foreign key constraint applied on "Name" column in "Student"table that referencing to "School" table's (Name)

By definition Foreign key refers to primary key of another table
