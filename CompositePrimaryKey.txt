When more than one field is used for making a primary key, then it is called "Composite Primary Key"

For Example---

Create table Students
(
ID int(5) NOT NULL,
LastName varchar(10) NOT NULL,
FirstName varchar(20) NOT NULL,
Age int(3),
Sub varchar(30),
constraint Pk_Student primary key(ID,LastName)
);

Here It will create table name Students with ID not null field,LastName not null field,FirstName not null field,Age and Sub field
Composite primary key constraint applied on two columns "ID" and "LastName"
